| [CVE-2007-3484] ** DISPUTED **  Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in search.php in Google Custom Search Engine allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the q parameter.  NOTE: this issue is disputed by the Google Security Team, who states that "Google does not provide the 'search.php' script referenced.  When a user creates a custom search engine, we provide them with a block of javascript to include on their site.  Some users write additional code around this block of javascript to further customize their website."
| [CVE-2007-3150] Google Desktop allows user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary programs via a man-in-the-middle attack that injects JavaScript, a www.google.com search IFRAME, and a META HTTP-EQUIV="refresh" that targets a www.google.com search for a local .exe file, which is displayed in the "results stored on your computer" portion of the search results, and when clicked invokes Google Desktop to execute this file.

| [CVE-2007-1085] Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Google Desktop allows remote attackers to bypass protection schemes and inject arbitrary web script or HTML, and possibly gain full access to the system, by using an XSS vulnerability in google.com to extract the signature for the internal web server, then calling the "under" parameter in Advanced Search with the proper signature.

CVE analysis as of 20061010 is inconclusive, although the original researcher is known to make mistakes.
| [CVE-2006-5228] Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the Google Gadget login.php (gadget/login.php) in Rob Hensley ackerTodo 4.2 and earlier allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the (1) up_login, (2) up_pass, or (3) up_num_tasks parameters.
| [CVE-2006-5019] Google Mini 4.4.102.M.36 and earlier allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a direct request for /search with an invalid client parameter, which reveals the path in an error message.

| [CVE-2005-3899] The automatic update feature in Google Talk allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU and memory consumption) by poisoning a target's DNS cache and causing a large update file to be sent, which consumes large amounts of CPU and memory during the signature verification, aka BenjiBug.

| [CVE-2004-2475] Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Google Toolbar 2.0.114.1 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script via about.html in the About section.  NOTE: some followup posts suggest that the demonstration code's use of the res:// protocol does not cross privilege boundaries, since it is not allowed in the Internet Zone. Thus this might not be a vulnerability.
| [CVE-2004-0251] Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in rxgoogle.cgi allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary script as other users via the query parameter.
